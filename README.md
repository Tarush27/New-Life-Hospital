# New-Life-Hospital
This is basically a web project made using certain technologies such as HTML5, CSS3 , JavaScript, My SQL and PHP. 
We have made this website for providing e-pharamcy to the users.
This website is simple and responsive and it has been designed using Carousel Wallpapers. There are many features and services provided to the users. First of all, they would have to login or Register. We have variuos services such as online appointment booking system, Membership Plans, 24/7 Support, Highly qualified doctors, fully computerized labs, wards and ambulance service.
We have used various components of HTML5, CSS3 such as divs, forms, input, nav, flexbox, linear gradient, cards etc.
If the user has any query, then we have provided Contact Us form or submitting their quieries. Not necessary for the user to come into the hospital, they could simple book appointment online by filling some details such as their name, problem, name of the doctor to be consulted etc. 
There are certain users who do not know that their problem fall in which category so there is no need to worry. There is a section named Our Doctors & beneath them we have mentioned a link known as See Profile. So, by clicking on that link they could see the complete detail of each & every doctor such as their contact number, department, charges, their schedule etc. 
Not only this, the doctor would be coming to the home of the users for their complete health checkup. 
In case of an emergency, the ambulance would be sent whenever required. 
Our staff is very user-friendly & it's guaranteed that the problem of the patients would be resolved at our hospital.
PHP and java script has been used for the backend developement such as storing, modification & to retrieve data along with MySql and phpMyadmin.
We have also added a COVID-19 widget that would show the latest updates each time the users log in the website.
